When your vehicle gets a flat tire you should follow a specific procedure on how to change your vehicle's tire safely and efficiently.  Here is a brief tutorial on how to change your vehicle's tire.

## 1. Getting Ready to Change the Tire
 1. **Find a Safe Location:**  When you notice that you have a flat tire, do not brake abruptly or turn.  Slowly reduce speed and find a flat, level, straight stretch of road to pull over.
 2. **Turn on Your Hazard Lights:** Your *"flashers"* will help other drivers see you on the side of the road.
3. **Apply the Parking Brake:**  The will minimize the possibility of your vehicle rolling.

## 2. Changing the Tire
1. Using your vehicle's lug wrench, turn the lug nuts counterclockwise until you loosen the lug nuts.  You do not remove them.  You may need to use some force.

***Example***
```javascript
const multiNums = (Force, Length) => {
    return Force * Length
}
const torque = multiNums(100, 1)
console.log(torque) //Expected torque value: 100
```
2.  Place the jack underneath the vehicle alongside the tire that is flat, then raise the vehicle 6 inches above the ground using the force generated by the jack.
3.  Unscrew the lug nuts in a star-shaped pattern.
```javascript
const lugs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const oddNum = lugs.filter(num => num % 2 !== 0);
const evenNum = lugs.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
let starOrder = oddNum.concat(evenNum);
console.log(starOrder)
```
4.  Remove the flat tire by gripping the tire by the treads and pulling it towards you.
5.  Mount the spare tire by lining up the rim of the tire with the lug bolts and gently pushing until the bolts show through the rim.
6.  Tighten the lug nuts by hand.
7.  Lower the vehicle so that the spare tire is now resting on the ground, but the full weight of the vehicle is not on the tire.
8.  Tighten the lug nut bolts with the lug wrench.
9.  Lower the vehicle completely to the ground.
